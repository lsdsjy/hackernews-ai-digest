#### [Submission URL](https://yamanot.es/) | 319 points | by [zdw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zdw) | [96 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45045307)

### **The Yamanote Line: Tokyo's Iconic Loop of Culture and Chaos**  

The **Yamanote Line (山手線)** is the beating heart of Tokyo’s rail network—a 35-kilometer loop that connects 30 of the city’s most vibrant districts. More than just a train line, it’s a cultural journey through Tokyo’s past and present, from neon-lit tech hubs to historic shrines, skyscrapers to underground izakayas.  

#### **Stops Along the Loop**  
- **Akihabara (秋葉原)** – The electric wonderland of anime, gaming, and PC parts.  
- **Ueno (上野)** – Museums, cherry blossoms, and Ameya-Yokochō market.  
- **Ikebukuro (池袋)** – Sunshine City, giant department stores, and anime subculture.  
- **Shinjuku (新宿)** – The world’s busiest station, skyscrapers, and Kabukichō nightlife.  
- **Shibuya (渋谷)** – Scramble Crossing, Shibuya Sky, and endless youth trends.  
- **Shinagawa (品川)** – Business hub with bullet train access to Osaka.  

**Fun Fact:** The **"Yamanote"** (山の手) literally means "mountain side," contrasting with **"Shitamachi" (下町)**—the old downtown areas like Asakusa and Ueno.  

#### **Why It Matters**  
- 🚄 **Operates every 2-4 minutes**—a lifeline for Tokyoites.  
- 🌆 **Encapsulates Tokyo's diversity**—from geek culture (Akiba) to luxury (Ebisu).  
- 🕰 **Evolving constantly**—new station **Takanawa Gateway** (高輪ゲートウェイ) opened in 2020 for future-proofing.  

#### **Bonus: Memorable Stations**  
- **Harajuku (原宿)** – Fashion mecca (Takeshita Street).  
- **Nippori (日暮里)** – Home to the vintage fabric district ("Nippori Textile Town").  
- **Sugamo (巣鴨)** – Known as "Granny's Harajuku" for its old-school shopping.  

The Yamanote Line isn’t just a train—it’s the **pulse of Tokyo**. Miss it, and you’ll miss the soul of the city.  

**Next time you visit: Ride the loop (takes ~1 hour) and watch Tokyo unfold.** 🚃✨  

*(Now, debate time: Best Yamanote Line station? Shinjuku for chaos? Shibuya for people-watching? Or a hidden gem like Komagome?)*

### Malicious versions of Nx and some supporting plugins were published

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/security/advisories/GHSA-cxm3-wv7p-598c) | 429 points | by [longcat](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=longcat) | [423 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45034496)

# **🚨 Critical Security Alert: Malicious Versions of Nx Published on npm**  

### **What Happened?**  
A series of **malicious versions** of the popular monorepo tool **Nx** and related plugins (`@nx/devkit`, `@nx/workspace`, `@nx/node`, etc.) were published to **npm** by an attacker. These versions contained code that:  
- **Scanned users' file systems**  
- **Collected sensitive credentials**  
- **Uploaded them to GitHub repos** under the victim’s accounts  

### **Affected Packages & Versions**  
Several Nx-related packages were compromised, including:  
- `nx` **(v21.5.0, 20.9.0, 20.10.0, 21.6.0, 20.11.0, 21.7.0, 21.8.0, 20.12.0)**  
- `@nx/devkit`, `@nx/js`, `@nx/workspace`, `@nx/node` **(v21.5.0, 20.9.0)**  
- Others like `@nx/eslint`, `@nx/key`, `@nx/enterprise-cloud`  

✔ **All malicious versions have since been REMOVED from npm.**  

### **How the Attack Worked**  
The breach was possible due to **two major GitHub workflow vulnerabilities**:  
1. **Bash Injection via PR Titles**  
   - A workflow script improperly processed pull request titles, allowing **arbitrary code execution**.  
   - Example: A PR titled `$(echo "You've been compromised")` would execute the command.  

2. **Elevated Permissions via `pull_request_target`**  
   - Unlike standard workflows, `pull_request_target` runs with **full repo access**, including GitHub tokens.  
   - Attackers exploited this to **trigger a privileged pipeline (`publish.yml`) and steal npm credentials**.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- The breach **did not modify the master branch** (branch protection prevented this).  
- The **npm token was leaked via a manipulated workflow**, allowing the attacker to **publish malicious packages**.  

### **What You Should Do**  
If you’re using Nx:  
- **Check your installed versions**: Ensure you're **not** running any of the compromised versions.  
- **Update immediately** to safe versions.  
- **Audit credentials** if you suspect exposure.

Stay vigilant, and always verify your dependencies! 🚀

### **Discussion Summary: Preventing npm Supply Chain Attacks**  

#### 🔹 **Main Concerns & Solutions**  
1. **Disabling npm Install Scripts**  
   - Many users suggested disabling npm install scripts globally (`npm config set ignore-scripts true`).  
   - **Pro:** Stops malicious `postinstall` scripts.  
   - **Con:** Some legitimate packages break (e.g., those needing compilation).  

2. **Using Sandboxing Tools**  
   - **Bubblewrap** (Linux) or **Firejail** were recommended to restrict npm scripts.  
   - *"Bubblewrap creates an isolated environment by symlinking /tmp, restricting file access."*  
   - **Warning:** If the host system is compromised, Bubblewrap alone isn’t foolproof.  

3. **Alternative Package Managers**  
   - **pnpm** gained praise for:  
     - Speed and deterministic installations.  
     - Ignoring lifecycle scripts by default (configurable).  
     - Workspace support for monorepos.  
   - *"Switched from yarn/npm to pnpm, never looked back."*  

---  

#### 🔹 **Containers & Sandboxes: Pros & Cons**  
- **Docker** was suggested but criticized for complexity.  
- **Bubblewrap’s Limitations:**  
  - Not a full container solution (unlike Docker/OCI).  
  - *"If npm is malicious, Bubblewrap might not save you—depends on attack vectors."*  

---  

#### 🔹 **Other Suggestions**  
- **Manifest whitelisting** (e.g., `package-lock.json` hashes).  
- **Running npm in read-only mode** (using Bubblewrap or similar).  
- *"Just don’t install random npm packages blindly."*  

---  

#### 🔹 **Meta Observations**  
- **NPM’s Inherent Risk:**  
  - *"99% of devs just run `npm install` without checking—malicious scripts execute instantly."*  
- **Cultural Shift Needed:**  
  - *"Copy-pasting install scripts from GitHub is the norm, but it’s dangerous."*  

**Final Takeaway:** No perfect solution exists yet, but **disabling scripts + sandboxing** reduces risk. 🚀

Here’s a summary of the Hacker News discussion about Rust, TypeScript, and web APIs:

### **Key Themes of the Discussion**
1. **Rust’s Strengths vs. Pain Points**  
   - **Pros:** Rust's fearless refactoring, compile-time checks, and memory safety were praised. Some highlighted its growing ecosystem and strong tooling.  
   - **Cons:** Long compile times and complexity in managing lifetimes (like `window.set_href` behavior in web contexts) were noted as pain points.  

2. **Comparison with TypeScript**  
   - Rust’s static typing was contrasted with TypeScript's dynamic typing, where runtime behavior (e.g., `window.location.href` assignments) can surprise developers.  
   - Debate arose over TypeScript’s ability to catch errors Rust would, with some arguing TypeScript’s type system lacks Rust’s strict compile-time guarantees.

3. **Web API Quirks**  
   - The discussion criticized legacy browser APIs (e.g., immediate page navigation on `location.href` assignment) as inconsistent with Rust’s ownership model.  
   - Workarounds in Rust (e.g., returning `!` or using explicit state machines) were proposed to handle side effects.  

4. **Developer Experience**  
   - Rust’s learning curve was acknowledged, but incremental compilation tools (e.g., `sccache`, `cranelift`) and debugging improvements made it manageable.  
   - Some argued Rust’s strictness prevents bugs, while others lamented its verbosity compared to TypeScript.  

### **Memorable Quotes**  
> *"Refactoring in dynamic languages is like sailing without a compass—Rust gives you a GPS."*  
> *"Browser APIs are stuck in the 90s… Rust’s design just exposes their flaws."*  
> *"TypeScript tries to tame JavaScript’s chaos, but Rust refuses to play by those rules."*  

### **Final Takeaway**  
The thread reflects Rust’s growing adoption despite friction with web-specific behaviors, while TypeScript remains pragmatic but imperfect. Developers valued Rust’s safety but debated whether its constraints justified the effort for web projects.

### The Therac-25 Incident (2021)

#### [Submission URL](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-therac-25-incident) | 432 points | by [lemper](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lemper) | [280 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45036294)

### **The Therac-25: A Deadly Software Failure That Every Developer Should Know**  

#### **When a "Minor Bug" Turned a Medical Device Into a Killer**  

In 1986, at the East Texas Cancer Center, a technician administered radiation therapy to a patient using the **Therac-25**, a machine designed to treat cancer. What happened next was the worst-case scenario in software engineering history—a malfunction that delivered **massive, fatal radiation overdoses**, leaving patients severely injured or dead.  

### **How a Simple Typing Error Unleashed Catastrophe**  
The technician—a trained professional—mistakenly selected **X-ray mode instead of electron beam mode**, quickly correcting it. The machine, designed with safety checks, should have prevented the beam from firing if the turntable position didn’t match. But then:  

- The machine displayed **"Malfunction 54"**—a cryptic error suggesting a minor dose input problem.  
- Believing no radiation had been delivered, the technician resumed treatment.  
- The patient **was hit with a massive radiation overdose**, feeling a searing pain likened to **"hot coffee poured on his back"**.  
.[*Read more…*](link-to-full-article)  

### **The Unraveling of the Therac-25 Disaster**  
Investigations revealed horrifying flaws:  
- **Race conditions in the software** meant the machine could fire without proper safety checks.  
- **No hardware interlocks**—the last safeguard had been removed to "simplify" the design.  
- **Coding errors compounded by overconfidence**: Engineers dismissed complaints, assuming the system was "bug-free" because it had previously worked.  
Ultimately, **at least six patients were overdosed**, suffering severe burns, paralysis, and death.  

### **Why Every Developer Must Know This Story**  
The Therac-25 remains one of the most infamous **software engineering failures in history**. Key takeaways:  
✔ **Over-reliance on software instead of fail-safes is dangerous.**  
✔ **User error should NEVER be deadly—defensive design matters.**  
✔ **Silent bugs can kill; thorough testing is non-negotiable.**  

Want to dive deeper into the terrifying breakdown of software vs. safety? **Read the full story here.**
